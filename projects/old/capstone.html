<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>My team and I made a microwave demultiplexer which breaks up a large input frequency range of 1-10 GHz down to 4 smaller output frequency ranges of 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, and 8-10GHz.</p>
<p>This project is a subsystem that can be used for radar detection to check if a vessel has appeared on another vessel's radar.</p>
<p>I worked in a team of 3 to complete a demultiplexer made up of 3 diplexers. Each team member took responsibility for a diplexer over a given frequency range. I was responsible for the high frequencies; therefore, I needed to design a diplexer made up of a low-pass filter with a cutoff at 8GHz and a high-pass or bandpass filter with a low frequency cutoff at 8GHz and a minimum high frequency cutoff at 10GHz.</p>

<p><strong>Final demultiplexer response:</strong></p>
<p>The full demultiplexer simulation was able to be made up of the 1-10GHz diplexer shown previously as well as 2 other diplexers at frequencies 1-4GHz and 1-8GHz.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>A full simulation of the demultiplexer system was successfully created, which separates 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, and 8-10GHz into 4 different output channels. The full demultiplexer response suffered some interference when combining all three diplexers together. The crossover frequencies did not meet at -3.01dB, and there were reflections within the passband. Some further optimization and improvement could be made by tuning the lengths of the stubs of each of the handpasses to line up. The manufacturability of the 1-8GHz and 1-4GHz boards was not achieved. However, the diplexer with a crossover frequency at 8GHz did meet specifications even when implemented using real values.
